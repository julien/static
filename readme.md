static
---

A very simple "static site generator"

Depends on [Markdown.pl](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Just drop `static.sh` in a directory (or eventually add to `$PATH`), and run it.

The script will look for any `*.md` files and convert them to `*.html`, and generate and `index.html` file too.
